Solubility Analysis: Organic Solvents & Cannabis FormulationsThis repository contains a cheminformatics pipeline to estimate the aqueous solubility (LogS) of common organic solvents and specific carriers used in cannabis formulations (e.g., terpenes, MCT oil components).The analysis is automated using GitHub Actions, performing calculations at Room Temperature ($25^{\circ}\text{C}$) as well as simulated deviations at $0^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $50^{\circ}\text{C}$.🧪 Project OverviewGoal: Provide quick solubility screening for solvent selection in extraction and formulation processes.Method:Base Solubility ($25^{\circ}\text{C}$): Calculated using the Delaney ESOL method via RDKit.Temperature Dependence: Extrapolated using a simplified Van 't Hoff approximation to simulate enthalpy effects at +/- $25^{\circ}\text{C}$.🚀 How to Run LocallyIf you wish to run the script on your own machine instead of GitHub Actions:Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solubility-analysis.git
cd solubility-analysis
Install Dependencies:You will need Python installed. We recommend using Conda or Pip.Bashpip install pandas numpy rdkit tabulate
Run the Script:Bashpython solubility_calc.py
This will generate a solubility_data.csv file with the results.🤝 For Collaborators (@ANUGAMAGE)How to Add New SolventsTo include more solvents in the analysis, you do not need to change the math. You only need to edit the list in the Python script.Open solubility_calc.py.Locate the list variable named solvents = [...].Add a new line inside the list following this format:Python{"Name": "Your Solvent Name", "SMILES": "YOUR_SMILES_STRING", "Type": "Category"},
Note: Ensure you have the correct SMILES string (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) for the molecule.Example AdditionIf you wanted to add Myrcene (a terpene), you would add:Python{"Name": "Beta-Myrcene", "SMILES": "CC(=C)CCC=C(C)C", "Type": "Cannabis Formulation"},
📊 Output DataThe workflow generates a CSV file with the following columns:Solvent: Common NameType: Category (Organic / Cannabis Formulation)MW: Molecular WeightLogP: LipophilicityLogS_0C: Solubility at Freezing PointLogS_25C: Solubility at Room TempLogS_50C: Solubility at Heated Temp🤖 GitHub ActionsThis repository is configured with CI/CD.Trigger: The analysis runs automatically on every push to the main branch.Artifacts: You can download the latest solubility_data.csv from the "Actions" tab in GitHub after a run completes.
